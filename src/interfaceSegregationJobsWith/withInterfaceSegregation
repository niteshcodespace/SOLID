Step 1 - Define interface called SoftwareEngineer

define three methods
	void doCoding();
	void coTesting();
	void doDeployment();

Step 1.1 - Define interface called QAEngineer

Step 2 - we define Tester class which implement QAEngineer not  SoftwareEngineer
because  We declare the method specific method  to QA 

 and need to provide implementation of  QA related method
 
 step 3 we created  TestSoftwareEngineer class where we create the object of 
 tester class  and called all method /
		void doTesting();
		
 
		
Note - Here we segregate the interface --using interface segregation approch
