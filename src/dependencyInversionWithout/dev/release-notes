we define two classes
BackEndDeveloper
FrontEndDeveloper

we create class Project  and define DeliverProject () 

which internall call 
BackEndDeveloper 
FrontEndDeveloper --- > methods() 


 we create bankingProject Class and call DeliverProject () 

disadvantage of this approach 

lot of object we create

if have to add new developer in this code we need to touch code 
-- voilation open closed principle 
---no interface used
