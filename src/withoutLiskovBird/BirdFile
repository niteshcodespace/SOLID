we define the Bird class
we have two method
fly()
eat()

we create the parrot class and extends Bird class 
 
 parrot can fly and eat --> it correct till here 
 
 we create the Penguin class and extends Bird class 
 
 logical penguin cannot fly but in Bird class we have
  fly() 

  This is the design problem 
  
 Technically  super class should not have such method
