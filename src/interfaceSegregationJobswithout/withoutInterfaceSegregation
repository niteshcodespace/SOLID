Step 1 - Define interface called SoftwareEngineer

define three methods
	void doCoding();
	void coTesting();
	void doDeployment();

Step 2 - we define Tester class which implement SoftwareEngineer
 and need to provide implementation of all three method
 
 step 3 we created  TestSoftwareEngineer class where we create the object of 
 tester class  and called all method 
 		void doCoding();
		void coTesting();
		void doDeployment();
		
		but tester can do only testing but due to bad design we are we have to implement the 
		method which not need by tester 
		
To slove this problem we have to apply Interface segregation approch
